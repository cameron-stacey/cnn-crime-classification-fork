were dispatched to the 3200 Block of E. Platte Ave. to a disturbance 
involving a man armed with a knife, who was threatening to kill people 
he randomly came in contact with.  Officers located the suspect a short 
time later.  The suspect was armed with a folding knife, and continued 
to threaten harm to himself and others.  The suspect was contained in an
 outdoor environment, and the area was cleared of citizens.  Officers 
engaged in direct, open air communication with the suspect for 
approximately one half hour, in an attempt to persuade the suspect to 
relinquish the knife and surrender.  The suspect covered himself with a 
sleeping bag he had in his possession, and attempted to break police 
containment.  Officers deployed two forms of less-lethal intervention 
(40mm less lethal munitions & taser) to prevent the suspect from 
fleeing.  The suspect, while distracted and incapacitated, was taken 
into custody without further incident.  The suspect, a 29 year old white
 male, was treated at a local area hospital for several non-life 
threatening self-inflicted lacerations.  No citizens or Officers were 
injured during this call for service.  Upon completion of medical 
treatment, the suspect will be booked into the El Paso County Criminal 
Justice Center for three counts of Felony Menacing.   On Friday, 11/04/2016 Sand Creek Patrol Officers
