Penrose Hospital to investigate a shooting.  The male victim arrived at 
the hospital with a gunshot wound to his leg.  The male stated he was 
shot while walking near downtown and stated that a dark sedan was 
driving by and fired the shot at him.  Upon viewing the victims injury 
and the trajectory of the bullet it appeared highly unlikely that the 
victim was shot as he described.  Through further follow up officers 
discovered that the victim was playing with a handgun when it 
accidentally fired, striking him in the leg.  The victim, identified as 
Phillip Terry an 18 year old male was charged with prohibited use of 
weapons and false reporting to authorities.  On 04/13/17 Gold Hill officers were dispatched to 
the High Country Lodge located in the 3600 block of W. Colorado Ave to 
investigate a reported stabbing.  Investigation revealed that an 
argument had taken place between the father and his 15 year old son.  
The disturbance turned physical and the 15 year old pulled out a pocket 
knife and cut his father in the abdomen.  The 15 year old fled the area
